4 Year Planner 
1. User Experience & Onboarding
Progressive data collection: Instead of one long form, use a multi-step wizard:

Major & start year

Completed courses (with smart suggestions as they type)

GENED completion (visual checklist with course recommendations)

Plan generation with preview

"Starter template" selection: Offer pre-built templates beyond just major:

"Accelerated" (heavy course loads)

"Study abroad" (lighter semesters with flexibility)

"Internship-focused" (summer terms free)

"Graduate school prep" (research opportunities built in)

Real-time validation: As users select completed courses, immediately show how it affects their remaining requirements

2. Smart Algorithm Enhancements
"Difficulty balancing": Ensure each semester has a mix of easy and challenging courses based on historical GPA data

Prerequisite-aware scheduling: Auto-adjust plan if prerequisites aren't met in the right sequence

Course availability intelligence: Weight courses higher that are consistently offered each semester vs. rarely offered courses

Professor quality factor: Incorporate PlanetTerp professor ratings into course recommendations

3. Plan Customization Features
"What-if" scenarios: Allow users to easily duplicate their plan and try different majors/minors

Semester swapping: One-click to swap entire semesters (Fall/Spring) for study abroad planning

Course bundles: Pre-defined groups of courses that work well together (e.g., "Data Science track" for CS majors)

Summer term integration: Smart suggestions for summer courses that accelerate progress

4. Requirement Tracking System
Visual progress bars for each requirement category:

Major core (75% complete)

Major electives (50% complete)

GENED categories (individual progress per category)

Total credits (90/120 complete)

"Click to fulfill": Click on any unmet requirement to see course options that fulfill it

Alternative fulfillment: Show when courses can fulfill multiple requirements and let users choose how to apply them

5. Export & Sharing Capabilities
Advisor-ready formats: PDF export optimized for academic advisor meetings

"Share for feedback": Generate a view-only link to share with advisors/family

Calendar integration: Export to Google Calendar with tentative course schedules

Degree audit simulation: Generate a report that mimics the official UMD degree audit

6. Data & Personalization
Anonymous analytics: Track which majors are most planned for, common course combinations (with user permission)

"Students like you": Show how similar students structured their plans (aggregated, anonymous data)

Save/restore via token: Generate a unique code to save plan and return later without login

Mobile-first design: Optimize for students planning on phones between classes

7. Integration Opportunities
RateMyProfessors linkage: Show professor ratings directly in course selection

Textbook cost estimates: Integrate with Amazon API to show estimated semester costs

Classroom location mapping: Show how far apart classes are for schedule planning

Peer planning: Optional collaboration features for student groups planning together

8. Error Prevention & Guidance
"Are you sure?" warnings when making potentially problematic changes:

Dropping prerequisites needed for future courses

Creating impossible prerequisite chains

Going significantly under/over credit limits

"Why this course?" explanations: Show the algorithm's reasoning for course placements

Alternative pathways: When requirements conflict, show multiple valid sequencing options

9. Performance Considerations
Client-side caching: Cache course data and requirements locally for fast interactions

Progressive loading: Load major requirements first, then GENED, then elective options

Search optimization: Implement debounced search with course code and title matching

Plan validation worker: Run requirement checking in a web worker to avoid UI blocking

10. Future Expansion Possibilities
Transfer student mode: Specialized workflow for students with significant transfer credits

Graduate school planning: Extend to 5-year bachelor's/master's programs

Scholarship tracking: Integrate scholarship requirements into planning

Career path mapping: Connect course choices to career outcomes and skill development

Implementation Phasing Recommendation
Phase 1 (MVP):

Basic major selection + completed courses

Simple plan generation from base templates

Manual course dragging between semesters

Basic requirement checking

PDF export

Phase 2:

Smart algorithm with GPA optimization

GENED requirement tracking

Course replacement with recommendations

Enhanced export options

Mobile responsiveness

Phase 3:

"What-if" scenarios

Professor ratings integration

Advanced validation and warnings

Social sharing features

Phase 4:

Transfer student optimization

Career pathway integration

Advanced analytics and insights

Key Differentiators from Existing Solutions
No login barrier - instant access for all students

True personalization - accounts for completed courses and transfer credits

Data-driven recommendations - uses actual grade distributions and course availability

Flexible customization - easy drag-and-drop with smart alternatives

Advisor-friendly outputs - professional exports that work with existing university processes

This approach positions your tool as the most accessible, intelligent, and practical planning solution for UMD students across all situations - from incoming freshmen to transfer students to those changing majors mid-career.
